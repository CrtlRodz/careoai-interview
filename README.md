# CareoAi Interview Test Project

This repository contains a modern React application developed for the CareoAi Frontend Engineer interview. It demonstrates React best practices, component-based architecture, pure CSS styling, and automated testing.

---

##  Overview

The app is a responsive user interface displaying a list of user cards. Each card includes:

- Name
- Position
- Profile image
- Message count
- Attachment count

Built with **React (CRA)** and styled using **pure CSS**, this project avoids external styling frameworks to maintain simplicity and control.

---

##  Features

- ** Component-Based Architecture**
  Reusable and modular components, such as the `Card` component.

- ** Pure CSS Styling**
  Responsive design with modular CSS and CSS variables for theming.

- ** Local Assets & Icons**
  SVG icons and user images integrated seamlessly into the UI.

- ** Automated Testing**
  Unit and integration tests powered by **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

- **Responsive Layout**
  Custom media queries ensure adaptability across devices.
